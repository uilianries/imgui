### Language bindings

_NB: those bindings may be more or less maintained, more or less close to the spirit of original API. People who create language bindings sometimes haven't used the C++ API themselves. ImGui was designed for C++ and some of the subtleties may be lost in translation with other languages. If your language supports it, I would suggest replicating the function overloading and default parameters used in the original, else the API may be harder to use. In doubt, always check the original C++ version first._
