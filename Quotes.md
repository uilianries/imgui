_"imgui revolutionised our game development, i cannot imagine making tools without it. from tiny test projects to a large console game, it's utterly dependable and delightful to use. its simple & deep, a rare combination._"
<br>-Alex Evans (Media Molecule)

_"Dear ImGui is stunning. I don't know how I lasted so long without ever knowing about this. I've removed all my old debugging GUI code and replaced it with this."_
<br>-Ron Gilbert (Terrible Toybox)"

_"Imgui is a small, well written immediate mode GUI that allowed me to build and very quickly iterate on my gpuvis tool features. Its portability also allowed me to easily get it running on Mac, Windows, and Linux. I really enjoy working with Omar and sincerely hope I never have to work with large bloated UI toolkits ever again. Love Imgui!"_
<br>-Michael Sartain (Valve Software)

_"ImGui is the perfect fit for any personal projects, games and R&D apps. I use it as a git module: easy to include and straight to the point, while still allowing me to create customised and advanced UI. A pleasure to use!"_
<br>-SÃ©bastien Hillaire (Frostbite / Electronic Arts)
