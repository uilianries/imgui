### Software doesn't maintain itself

Your contributions are keeping this project alive. Dear ImGui is used by [many projects](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/wiki/Software-using-dear-imgui). The library is available under a free and permissive license, but continued maintenance and development are a full-time endeavor which we would like to sustain and grow. In addition to maintenance and stability there are many desirable features yet to be added. We are consistently doing R&D and sitting on unfinished features needing work. We are answering [community questions/issues](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/issues?q=) in the open and in one centralized place in order to create a database of knowledge. We have created a [test engine & test suite](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui_test_engine). We are ensuring at every moment that the library is the most efficient it can be (with strict standards such as: 0 allocation on most frames). We are designing easy and well-documented transition to updated APIs when changes are necessary etc.

Dear ImGui has first been conceptualized and prototyped in 2012, first released and developed as a side-project from 2014, then became my main focus from the end of 2017. Thanks to our sponsors, in 2020, we poured ~2500 hours of work into Dear ImGui R&D. In 2021 ~1600 hours.
